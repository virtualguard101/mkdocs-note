Introduction to C++ programming language.

## Same Name, Different Path

This file is also named `intro.md` but located at `language/cpp/intro.md`

With the new assets manager, there's no conflict because:
- Python intro assets: `assets/language.assets/python/intro/`
- C++ intro assets: `assets/language.assets/cpp/intro/`

The tree-based structure prevents naming conflicts!
