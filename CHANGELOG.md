## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Frontmatter Metadata System** (#15): Implemented comprehensive frontmatter management system for notes
  
  - Added `NoteFrontmatter` data class to `data_models.py` for storing note metadata
  
  - Created `frontmatter_manager.py` module with extensible metadata registration system:
    
    - `MetadataRegistry`: Central registry for managing metadata fields
    
    - `MetadataField`: Definition class for metadata fields with type validation
    
    - `FrontmatterParser`: YAML frontmatter parser for markdown files
    
    - `FrontmatterManager`: High-level facade for frontmatter operations
  
  - Standard metadata fields: `date`, `permalink`, `publish`
  
  - Support for custom metadata fields through registration interface
  
  - Metadata validation system with type checking and custom validators

- **Template System Enhancement**: Improved note template framework
  
  - Template variables now only substitute in frontmatter section, keeping note body clean
  
  - Support for both new frontmatter-style templates and legacy templates
  
  - Automatic detection and handling of template types
  
  - Updated default template with frontmatter structure

- **Metadata Integration**:
  
  - `NoteProcessor` now extracts frontmatter from markdown notes
  
  - `NoteInfo` dataclass extended with optional `frontmatter` field
  
  - `NoteCreator` generates notes with proper frontmatter structure

### Changed

- **Dependencies**: Added `pyyaml>=6.0` for YAML frontmatter parsing

- **Default Template**: Updated to include frontmatter with standard fields

- **Project Configuration**: Added `build-system` to `pyproject.toml` for proper package installation

### Technical Details

- **Extensibility**: Metadata system uses registration pattern for easy extension without modifying core code

- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing notes without frontmatter continue to work normally

- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints throughout frontmatter system

- **Testing**: Added 31 unit tests for frontmatter management system (all passing)

### Documentation

- Enhanced code documentation with detailed docstrings

- Added inline examples for metadata registration usage

## 1.2.2 - 2025-10-13

### Fixed

- **Dependencies**: Added `pyyaml>=6.0` and `pymdown-extensions>=10.15` to `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py`


## 1.2.1 - 2025-10-13

### Fixed

- **CLI Configuration Loading**: Fixed CLI tools not respecting user's custom configuration from `mkdocs.yml` (#23)
  
  - Previously, CLI commands (`validate`, `init`, `new`, etc.) always used default configuration values, ignoring user's custom settings in `mkdocs.yml`
  
  - This caused commands to operate on wrong directories (e.g., validating `docs/notes` when user configured `docs/usage`)
  
  - Implemented `load_config_from_mkdocs_yml()` function to parse and load plugin configuration from `mkdocs.yml`
  
  - Added automatic `mkdocs.yml` file discovery in current and parent directories
  
  - CLI now correctly applies user's custom configuration for all commands
  
  - Added comprehensive unit tests for configuration loading functionality


## 1.2.0 - 2025-10-11

### Added

- **CLI Note Removal**: Added `mkdocs-note remove` (alias: `rm`) command for deleting notes and their asset directories (#19)
  
  - Removes note file and its corresponding asset directory
  
  - Option `--keep-assets` to preserve asset directory while removing note
  
  - Option `--yes` / `-y` to skip confirmation prompt
  
  - Automatically cleans up empty parent directories after removal
  
  - Validates file extension before removal

- **CLI Orphaned Assets Cleanup**: Added `mkdocs-note clean` command for cleaning up orphaned asset directories (#19)
  
  - Scans notes directory and assets directory to find orphaned assets
  
  - Identifies asset directories without corresponding note files
  
  - Option `--dry-run` to preview what would be removed without actually removing
  
  - Option `--yes` / `-y` to skip confirmation prompt
  
  - Automatically cleans up empty parent directories after cleanup

- **CLI Note Movement**: Added `mkdocs-note move` (alias: `mv`) command for moving/renaming notes and directories
  
  - Mimics shell `mv` command behavior: if destination exists and is a directory, moves source into it
  
  - Moves or renames note file or entire directory with its asset directories simultaneously
  
  - Supports moving single notes or entire directories with all notes inside
  
  - Supports both simple renaming and moving into existing directories
  
  - Example: `mkdocs-note mv docs/notes/dsa/ds/trees docs/notes/dsa` moves to `docs/notes/dsa/trees`
  
  - Option `--keep-source-assets` to preserve source asset directory
  
  - Option `--yes` / `-y` to skip confirmation prompt
  
  - Automatically creates necessary parent directories
  
  - Automatically cleans up empty parent directories in source location
  
  - Includes rollback mechanism in case of errors
  
  - Intelligently handles tree-based asset structure when moving directories

- **Core Modules**: Added new core modules for note management
  
  - `note_remover.py`: Handles note file and asset directory removal
  
  - `note_cleaner.py`: Manages orphaned asset cleanup and note movement operations

  - `notes_mover.py`: Handles note file and directory movement and renaming with their assets correspondingly
  
  - Both modules properly handle tree-based asset structure with `.assets` suffix

### Changed

- **CLI User Experience**: Enhanced CLI commands with better user feedback
  
  - Added emoji indicators for better visual feedback (‚úÖ, ‚ùå, ‚ö†Ô∏è, üìù, üìÅ, üîç)
  
  - Added clear confirmation prompts for destructive operations
  
  - Improved error messages with helpful suggestions

## 1.1.4 - 2025-10-09

### Fixed

- **CLI Note Creation**: Fixed `mkdocs-note new` command validation logic issue (#14)
  
  - Previously, the command was using `file_path.parent` as the notes directory for validation, causing incorrect asset tree structure checks
  
  - This resulted in `validate` command passing but `new` command failing with "Asset tree structure is not compliant" errors
  
  - Now both `create_new_note()` and `validate_note_creation()` methods use the configured `notes_dir` from settings for consistent validation
  
  - This ensures that `mkdocs-note validate` and `mkdocs-note new` use the same validation logic


## 1.1.3 - 2025-10-08

### Added

- **Timestamp Configuration**: Added `timestamp_zone` configuration option (default: `UTC+0`) to ensure consistent timestamp display across different deployment environments

  - Implemented automatic fallback to UTC timezone when invalid timezone format is provided

  - Added comprehensive documentation for timestamp configuration options

### Fixed

- **Timestamp Display**: Fixed issue where timestamp was not displayed correctly in note files - plugin now uses configured timezone for timestamp display


## 1.1.2 - 2025-10-06

### Fixed

- Fixed `mkdocs-note init` command to correctly use tree-based asset directory structure
  
  - Previously, the init command was creating asset directories in a flat structure (e.g., `assets/note-name/`) instead of mirroring the notes directory hierarchy
  
  - Now uses `get_note_relative_path()` function consistently across all components to ensure proper tree-based structure
  
  - Updated `_check_compliance()` method to correctly validate tree-based structures with `.assets` suffix on first-level subdirectories
  
  - This ensures that `mkdocs-note init` and `mkdocs-note new` create consistent directory structures


## 1.1.1 - 2025-10-06

### Changed

- **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Improved assets manager to use tree-based path structure instead of linear table

  - Assets are now organized by note's relative path from notes directory, preventing conflicts between notes with same name in different subdirectories

  - First-level subdirectories in assets tree now have `.assets` suffix for better identification (e.g., `assets/dsa.assets/anal/intro/` for note `dsa/anal/intro.md`)

  - Updated `AssetsCatalogTree` to support hierarchical path management

  - Updated `AssetsProcessor` to calculate asset paths based on note's relative location

  - Updated `NoteCreator` to create asset directories using the new path structure

  - Improved asset path conversion in plugin to use correct relative paths from note file location

### Fixed

- Fixed asset directory conflicts when notes have the same name but exist in different paths (#10)

- Fixed asset link replacement issues in note files - plugin now correctly converts relative image references to proper paths during MkDocs build (#10)

- Fixed path resolution in plugin to properly handle `docs_dir` and calculate correct relative paths for assets

## 0.0.1 - 2025-09-05

### Added

- The project was initialized 

- The initial framework is based on https://github.com/stalomeow/note/blob/5fa56a9fdfa4c9b6511c5dc0c3d3620ae0aa04c3/scripts/obsidian.py

- However, the framework and features are too redundant to continue development and maintenance independently for me.
