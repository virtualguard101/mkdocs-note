MkDocs Note is a plugin for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) that automatically manages notes in your documentation site. It's designed to work seamlessly with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme to create a unified note-taking and documentation experience.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> **Breaking Changes**
>
> Since `v2.0.0`, the plugin uses a co-located asset structure instead of the old unified tree structure, where assets are stored next to their notes. This makes it easier to manage and move notes with their assets together. 
>
> However, you need to manually move your existing assets to the new location.
>
> By the way, I think the plugin after `v2.0.0` can not only as a "notebook manager", but also an efficient documentations manager because of its powerful and flexible asset management system.
